examination-marks
=================

Python script for new examination marks notification (TH Nuernberg). As the
university's mail notification is often too late, we can pull new releases by
ourselves :3

For students enrolled at TH Nuernberg (http://www.th-nuernberg.de/) only!!

You need to set first:

    USERNAME = 'student1234'
    PASSWORD = 'passwd1234'
    SMTPSERVER = 'smtp.foo.bar'
    RECIPIENTS = ['student1234@foo.bar']
